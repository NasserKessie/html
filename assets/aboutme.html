    <h3>I am a 22-year-old civil engineering student living in Somalia. I have a strong passion for learning and have expanded my horizons by traveling to Kenya and Ethiopia. Alongside my studies in civil engineering, I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp, where I am honing my programming skills with the goal of becoming a professional programmer.

        Fluent in English, Arabic, and Somali, I enjoy connecting with people from diverse backgrounds, which enriches my understanding of different cultures and perspectives. My education in engineering, coupled with my interest in technology, allows me to approach problems creatively and systematically. I am excited about the future and eager to apply my knowledge in both civil engineering and programming to make a positive impact in my community.</h3>
